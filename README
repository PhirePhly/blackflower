OVERVIEW

  Description:
  ------------
  Black Flower CAD is an open source Computer Aided Dispatch / Computer 
  Aided Logging software package.  
  
  Contact Information:
  --------------------
  The current version of this software can be downloaded from:
    http://www.forlorn.net/cad/

INSTALLATION
  
  Server Requirements:
  --------------------
  * MySQL database server v4.0+
  * PHP version 4, with MySQL integration.
  * Apache webserver running in Prefork mode, with PHP integration.
  
  * The recommended (best tested) platform for the server is Debian Linux, 
    however Fedora Core and Microsoft Windows server platforms have also been 
    tested successfully.
  
  
  Client Requirements:
  --------------------
  * Mozilla v1.5+ or Firefox v1.0+ web browser
  * Client system time synchronized with CAD server system time
  
  * The recommended (best tested) platform for the clients is Microsoft 
    Windows XP, however Linux clients have also been tested successfully.
  
  The system _may_ function adequately with older revisions of Netscape based
  browsers.  The current version _will_NOT_ operate correctly with Microsoft 
  Internet Explorer.  Other browsers are untested.
  
  
  Installation Quick Guide
  ------------------------
  1) Install the MySQL database server on the target server.
     *** Linux instructions coming later; refer to MySQL documentation ***
     *** Windows instructions coming later; refer to MySQL documentation ***
     Currently, a MySQL installation with NO permission/password 
     configurations *is required*.  Upcoming changes to the initialization 
     script will alter this requirement.  Or, if you have a fair level of
     MySQL command line administration skills, read the installation script
     and initialize the system manually using the MySQL root account.
  
  2) Install Apache and PHP on the target server.
     *** Linux instructions coming later; refer to Apache/PHP docs ***
     *** Windows instructions coming later; refer to Apache/PHP docs ***
  
  3) Unpack the CAD distribution archive in the desired Web directory.
  
  4) Configure the CAD system.
     If bash and perl are available on your Linux or UNIX server, change 
     to the CAD directory and execute the "initialize.sh" script.  
     This will create and load the default SQL tables and otherwise 
     prepare the system for running.  You will be prompted to enter
     certain usernames and passwords.  Or, if you have a fair level of
     MySQL command line administration skills, read the installation script
     and initialize the system manually using the MySQL root account.
  
     *** Manual/Windows documentation to be added ***  
  
  5) Configure your Apache installation to serve the CAD application.

  6) Synchronize the server and all clients to the same time.  
     See NTP discussion below.
  
  
  To use the CAD system:
  ----------------------
  On the server, start or restart Apache and MySQL as needed.
  On the client, load your web browser and go to the CAD URL, e.g.:

    http://servername.domainname.com/path-to-CAD-application/

  *or* (if you have configured your system for HTTPS:)

    https://secureservername.domainname.com/path-to-CAD-application/
  
  Log in with the CAD administrator username and password created 
  during step 4 above.  The default username is 'Administrator' 
  and the default password is 'admin' (case sensitive.)
  
  Click on the "Settings" tab, then "Edit Users" in the Administration 
  dialog, and create the required usernames and passwords for CAD users.

  An access level less than 10 should be used for normal users.  
  Access levels of 10 or greater create a system administrator account.  

  Day to day use of CAD should be done through normal, rather than
  system administrator, accounts.
  
  
  Best Common Practices
  ---------------------
  1)  NTP
  
  Time synchronization is required for coordination of timestamps 
  generated on the server with those generated on the clients.  
  This can be done by running a standalone (stratum 1) NTP server 
  if on a completely isolated network, or by connecting all systems 
  to the Internet NTP network.  In the Internet case it is 
  recommended to run a caching NTP server on the CAD server, and 
  synchronize all clients to that.  A popular freeware Windows NTP 
  client is available from http://www.oneguycoding.com/automachron/.
  
  2)  Syslog
  
  CAD will use the native system logging functionality on UNIX or 
  Windows systems.  On UNIX systems, CAD uses the local4 logging level.  
  On Windows, messages are logged to the Application section of the 
  Event Viewer.  Edit session.inc to alter these defaults.
  
  3)  Network security
  
  Any network running CAD or other such systems should be kept 
  isolated from insecure network traffic such as the Internet.  
  Any consumer grade or better hardware firewall is sufficient for 
  purposes of CAD network security.  
  
  In an extremely small or field-deployable CAD installation, it is 
  possible to install the server on a system which will also be one
  of the clients of the installation.  If that is the only system 
  expected to use CAD, a software firewall on that host is sufficient 
  if configured correctly.  Software firewalls are generally 
  recommended for any Microsoft Windows client or server systems 
  which will be exposed to insecure network traffic.  
  
  Ports required to be open on CAD server for client communication:
  
    80 (http)   - Normal operation: HTTP on a secure network.
  *or*
   443 (https)  - If using secure HTTPS on an insecure network
  
  Other ports that may be used in a full network environment:
  
    53 (domain) - If using the CAD server as a DNS server.
    67 (bootps) - If using the CAD server as a DHCP server.
   123 (ntp)    - If using the CAD server as an NTP server.

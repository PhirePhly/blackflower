Version 1.9.0 - 2012-07-08
--------------------------
[major]  THE PASSWORD HASH FORMAT HAS CHANGED AS OF 1.9.0.  All passwords 
         generated on previous versions must be reset per this example
         (starting with the Administrator account for convenience):

  1. Set $DEBUG=1 in cad.conf, 
  2. Attempt to log in as Administrator (which will fail), 
  3. Observe the hash displayed on the login failure screen,
  4. Update the MySQL users table with the displayed hash: 
     mysql>  update cad.users set password='<hash>' where id=1;
  5. Log in as Administrator with your new password.
  6. Go to the System Admin tab and change all other users' passwords.
  7. Set $DEBUG=0 in cad.conf.

[major]  Implemented channel assignments to incidents.  Channels may
         be configured by the sysadmin to be available or unavailable
         (for reference only), repeater or simplex (for display purposes),
         then assigned by a dispatcher in the edit_incident window.

[major]  Implemented optional read-only mode and associated config settings.
         If read-only settings are not defined, the app will remain wide open
         (in read-write mode) for all connections.
         
[minor]  Users are now locked out after repeated incorrect login attempts
         (default limit = 5 attempts, configurable in cad.conf.)

[minor]  Implemented forced password expiry.

[bugfix] Fixed bugs in error checking for System Admin > Edit Users.


--------------------------
Version 1.8.2 - 2011-09-03
--------------------------
[bugfix] Set 'Attached to Incident' in schema to match case sensitive magic
         code comparison.


--------------------------
Version 1.8.1 - 2011-07-09
--------------------------
[minor]  Clarified incident unit timestamp terminology.

[minor]  Added v1.7 timestamps to Units report.

[bugfix] Fixed incident database queries around stale incident locks.


--------------------------
Version 1.8.0 - 2011-06-22
--------------------------
[major]  Improved multi-station incident editing.  Instead of multiple 
         simultaneous users being able to edit an incident, but only the 
         first user being allowed to save their changes, subsequent users 
         now have a read-only view.  They are able to enter Incident Notes
         and manage Incident Unit attachments, but only the first user
         (with a read-write view) able to make changes to the text fields 
         in the upper portion of the window.

         Users are able to force a takeover of read-write privileges, in 
         case of client system crashes, dispatcher switches, etc. 

         The login name of the user who has an incident open is also shown 
         in the main Incidents list next to the call/incident number.  
         Users can hover the mouse over that login to see that CAD user's
         full name.

         Incident lines in the main Incident screen list are now shaded in 
         tan when they are open by another user, and shaded in a lighter 
         grey when they are open by the current user.  

[major]  Revised unit auto-page dialog for increased clarity, and fixed
         mistaken additions: now force the user to select from dropdown 
         rather than defaulting to the first person in the list.

[major]  Cleaned up bulletins user interface.  Implemented database import 
         of bulletins from old/backup database.

[major]  Added "time since last update" column to incidents screen, 
         displaying the time since last update to an incident if it is 
         more than 15 minutes stale.  After 60 minutes the time turns red, 
         and after 120 minutes it blinks red, until it is updated.

[minor]  Added additional timestamp fields from v1.7 to incident Reports.

[minor]  Removed "Off Playa" from status options, "Out of Service" is 
         sufficient.

[minor]  Log viewer "message type" field is no longer displayed by default; 
         must now be actively enabled in cad.conf before that Preference 
         is available.  (Feature used for Wildflower, not for Black Rock.)

[minor]  In main Incidents list, if the list of an incident's assigned units 
         is truncated due to being too long to be displayed on screen, the
         user may now hover over that abbreviated list to see a tooltip of
         the full list of all assigned units.

[minor]  In Incidents list, added similar abbreviations for, and hover-over
         tooltips for, lengthy Details and Location fields.

[minor]  In Incidents screen, added tooltips to Unit Availability,
         showing the location, personnel, and notes of each unit.

[minor]  Added 'Comm Duty Chief' to default list of assignments.

[minor]  Streamlined unit deletion workflow: grayed out editing options 
         while in the middle of deletion; added "Abort Deletion" button.
         
[minor]  Extracted unit roles into a table rather than enums.

[minor]  In Incidents screen, added links from Units assigned to calls 
         directly to the appropriate incident.  (In the future, status 
         adjustments may be implemented via controls appearing on the 
         units' name text itself, but this is a valuable interim step.)

[minor]  Disabled editing fields when editing (viewing) a completed incident.

[minor]  Changed incident completion timestamp from client-generated to 
         server-generated, to match the other timestamps.  
         
[minor]  The four main (upper) timestamps in the edit-incident window 
         now also display the short day name (Sun..Sat) for any timestamps
         that occurred on a previous calendar day.

[minor]  The edit-incident window now shows an attached unit's name and 
         dispatched time in bold if dispatch was within the last 5 minutes.

[bugfix] The Incidents screen once again shows new incidents in bold
         if that incident was created within the last 5 minutes.

[bugfix] Removed meta refresh tag typo.  No longer wrongly display the text
         of a page's title inline in any iframes below the header bar.

[bugfix] "Busy" units can no longer be attached to incidents.

[bugfix] Converted all remaining PHP short open tags to long form.

[bugfix] Complain if config file is missing, instead of failing silently.

[bugfix] Cleaned up incidents database query and filtering logic.

[bugfix] When creating a Unit, only allow user to type as many characters 
         in the unit name field as the database actually accepts (20).

[bugfix] When reopening an incident, set it visible in list, and show the
         "Cancel" button, not "Abort" button which can cause accidental 
         deletion of the incident from database.

[bugfix] Prevented Generic units from being simultaneously attached
         multiple times to any one given incident.  They still may be
         attached to multiple incidents simultaneously, and a given
         Generic unit may still be sequentially attached multiple
         times to any one given incident (attach, then release, then
         attach again.)

[bugfix] Don't show System Admin tab in menu if access level is 
         actually too low to use System Admin features (edge case: 
         affected 2 user accounts who were set to level 9.)
